## Archive of known GYBE recordings

**PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE PROCEEDING:**
Here is a list of GYBE shows from 1997-2002 that were known to be recorded.
Notation:
[H] = Have
[H - L] = Have, but lossy
[H - i] = Have, but incomplete
[?] = Unsure if I have the recording, possibly it is mislabeled or I am not sure if a recording actually exists.
If a show is listed in red, that means I do not have the recording nor can I find one anywhere on the internet, but I know that one exists because I can find records of its existence on the internet but not the recording itself.
